# Space X Launches Web App

Please find in this repository the code for a web app using flutter that uses Space X's rest APIs to present a timer for their next upcoming launch and information about their other remaining upcoming launches, the app also gives the ability for users to save upcoming launches as a favourites. The app uses navigation and manages state using the provider package. UI components respond to different screen sizes. 

Please note the app is not finished yet however the UI components and classes that have been created so far have been fully unit and widget tested.
